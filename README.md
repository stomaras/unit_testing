# unit_testing
a simple example with some tests

this project has 3 classes


1)MyMath.java:

has 2 methods a)public int reversenumber(int number): which return the contrary number to what we gave 

b)public double divide(int num, int denom):which return the division between the two numbers num and denom ,also handle the exceptions in the case at which denom = 0

Now i testing the Functionality of first method with the MyMathTest_ReverseNumber_Parameterized.java and for the second method i testing this with MyMathTest.java all cases(normal,extreme,exceptions)e.t.c.


2)MyFileUtilities.java:

 has one method readFile method and one default constructor .the readfile help us to read the txt file appropriate and return an array with the grades

I testing the readFile method with the MyFileUtilitiesTest.java and in this we handle the exceptions, with the help from the @Rule annotation .


3)MyArrayOperations.java:

this class has one method getGradeFrequencies method which return an array with the the frequency of recurrence of degrees.

I testing this class with MyArrayOperationsTest.java which with the help of mock doing the test

At the end I also have create the MyFirstSuiteTest.java which help us run 2 classes at the same time
